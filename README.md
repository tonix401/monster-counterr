## 🚀 Quick Start

Don't worry if you're not familiar with coding! Follow these simple steps to get Monster Counter running on your computer.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to install **Node.js**. This will be responsible for actually running the code:

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the **LTS version** (long term support)
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
4. You might need to restart

### Step 1: Download the Project

**Option A: Using Git**

If you have Git installed, run these two commands using a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/tonix401/monster-counterr.git
```
```
cd monster-counterr
```

**Option B: Download as ZIP**

1. Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page
2. Select **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
4. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder:
   - **Windows**: Open the folder, then type `cmd` in the address bar and press Enter
   - **Mac**: Right-click the folder while holding Control, select "New Terminal at Folder"
   - **Linux**: I don't think I need to tell you

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

In your terminal/command prompt, type this command and press Enter:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all the necessary files. It might take a few minutes.

### Step 3: Start the Application

Once installation is complete, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

I added some fluff for the ✨ aestetics ✨, but essentially you should see a message like:
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:14120/
```

### Step 4: Open in Your Browser

1. Open your browser (Chrome has some nice features for dropdowns, so I recommend it. Any other should also work fine though)
2. Go to: **http://localhost:14120/**
3. Do not close the terminal, that would kill it
3. Start managing your encounters! 🎲

### Stopping the Application

When you're done destroying your players hopes and dreams:
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to stop the server
- Now you can close it

### Running It Again Later

Next time you want to use Monster Counter:
1. Open a terminal in the project folder
2. Run `npm run start`
3. Open **http://localhost:14120/** in your browser
